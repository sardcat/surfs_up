# surfs_up!
Ohau weather analysis using Jupyter Notebook, SQLite & Flask.

## Overview
An avid entrepeneur has approached "the Team" requesting exploratory analysis of opening a Surf n'Shake shop in Oahua. A potential investor to the client, a local 
surfing guru, has expressed concerns regarding weather trends at the proposed location; namely the typical amount of rainfall to be expected, hopefully to quell 
the fear of a "wipeout". Using collected meterological data from reporting weather stations in Oahua for the years 2010 to 2018, "the Team" has prepared
statistical rainfall analysis for presentation by the client to the prospective investor.
